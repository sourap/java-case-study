# Case study 

## Setting
This case study puts you in the position of a Java backend developer at trivago. There has been a decision at the management
level to re-implement the backend from scratch and see whether the new solution can replace the legacy system which has grown
over the past several years.

## Your task
First take a look at the interface `HotelSearchEngine`. Your task will be to implement the two given functions in the 
concrete implementation in `HotelSearchEngineImpl`:

* `initialize`: this function is used to read the .csv (comma separated value) files initially. Take a look at the database schema section for further details.
* `performSearch`: executes the actual search. You are given a concrete search and can use the `OfferProvider` interface to retrieve offers from the advertisers.
 
The `initialize` function will be called one time during startup, whereas the `performSearch` function will be called multiple times. Make sure to do the initializations in the former function and execute the latter as quickly as possible. Also, every call to `OfferProvider.getOffersFromAdvertiser` retrieves offers from advertisers via a network request. It is very costly, so don't call it unnecessarily!
 
## Database schema
The data for your search engine is stored in csv files: 

* `advertisers.csv`: contains an `id` and the name of the advertiser
* `cities.csv`: contains ten cities with a name and an `id`
* `hotel_advertiser.csv`: models the m-n relationship between hotels and advertisers; every advertiser might have 
 offers for m hotels and each hotel might be offered by n advertisers. Contains two columns, referencing the ids of
 `advertisers` and `hotels`
* `hotels`: the given hotels for your search engine. Contains an `id` field and the foreign key to the `cities` table. Next, you have five columns that further describe the hotel: the number of clicks and impressions over the last week, its name, the user rating (0 - 100), and the hotel star rating (1 - 5).

## Important Notes
### Scope
* Focus on implementing a minimum viable product, that is, implement the class `HotelSearchEngineImpl` in a way that correct offers and hotels are returned for a given search query.
* We respect your time, and expect the whole case study to only take about 2 hours. Don't spend your whole weekend trying to impress us with anything fancy.
* Add comments in plain text or pseudocode where you can imagine improvements or have some general ideas.

### Hints
* You can use the given unit tests, but beware that they are not exhaustive (feel free to add more).
* If necessary, you can extend all classes with additional methods, but you should not change the method signatures in `HotelSearchEngine`.  
 
## Building
We have provided a Gradle build file as well as Eclipse and Idea project files for convenience, but we use Gradle internally. Here are some useful gradle commands for this project:

* `gradle`/`gradle build`: compile and test
* `gradle clean`: delete all of the build artifacts
* `gradle classes`/`gradle testClasses`: compile source/test Java classes
* `gradle test`: run unit tests
